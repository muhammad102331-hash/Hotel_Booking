Key Findings with Visual Insights
1. The Cancellation Crisis: 37% of Revenue at Risk
Booking Cancellation Distribution

The Story: Looking at our booking data, we discovered a startling reality - 37 out of every 100 bookings are canceled. The bar chart reveals this stark contrast: while 63,000+ bookings were completed successfully, nearly 37,000 guests changed their minds and canceled.

What This Means:

Imagine filling 370 rooms in a 1,000-room hotel, only to have them suddenly become empty
This creates a domino effect: lost revenue, wasted resources, and missed opportunities to fill those rooms
Staff planning becomes challenging when you can't predict actual occupancy
The Visual Impact: The chart shows two towering bars - the blue (not canceled) significantly higher than the orange (canceled), but the orange bar is still alarmingly large. This isn't a minor issue; it's a business-critical challenge.

2. Tale of Two Hotels: Why City Hotels Struggle More
Reservation Status by Hotel Type

The Story: When we compared our City Hotels to Resort Hotels, a clear pattern emerged. City Hotels are experiencing a 42% cancellation rate compared to Resort Hotels' 28%.

What the Data Reveals: The side-by-side comparison shows that while both hotel types receive significant bookings, City Hotels see a much larger proportion colored in the "canceled" shade. This 14-percentage-point difference represents thousands of lost room-nights.

Why This Happens:

Business travelers (who prefer City Hotels) have more flexible schedules
Corporate bookings often change due to meeting cancellations
Resort guests (vacation travelers) are more committed to their plans
Leisure travelers have made emotional investments in their trips
Business Impact: City Hotels need different strategies than Resort Hotels - one-size-fits-all policies won't work.

3. The Price Story: Following the Money Across Time
Average Daily Rate Trends

The Story: When we tracked room prices over three years (2015-2017), an interesting pattern emerged. Both hotel types maintain competitive pricing, with rates hovering around similar ranges, but City Hotels (orange line) show more volatility than the steadier Resort Hotels (green line).

Reading the Chart:

The green line (Resort Hotel) flows relatively smoothly, showing vacation travelers are more predictable
The orange line (City Hotel) has more spikes and valleys, reflecting business travel's unpredictable nature
Both lines trend together, suggesting market-wide factors affect pricing
Key Observations:

Prices range from $50 to $150+ per night across both properties
Seasonal peaks are visible but manageable
Neither hotel is dramatically overpricing or underpricing
Strategic Insight: The pricing itself isn't the problem - it's competitive. The challenge lies in matching the right price to the right guest at the right time.

4. Seasonal Patterns: The Rhythm of Bookings
Monthly Booking Cancellations

The Story: This monthly view reveals the heartbeat of our booking business. Watch how the blue (not canceled) and orange (canceled) bars rise and fall together throughout the year.

Monthly Booking Trends:

Peak Season: Summer months (June-August) have highest bookings AND highest cancellations
Low Season: Winter months (December-February) have fewer bookings overall
Cancellations follow booking volume - more bookings = more cancellations
Strategic Insight:

Focus retention efforts during peak booking months when stakes are highest
Implement flexible policies during low season to maintain occupancy
Prepare for cancellation surges before summer season
5. Geographic Analysis: The Portugal Problem
Top 10 Countries with Cancellations

The Striking Visual: The pie chart reveals something shocking - a massive slice (70.8%) belongs to Portugal. This single country dominates cancellations, making all other countries look tiny in comparison.

Top 10 Countries by Cancellation Volume:

Portugal (PRT) - 70.8% of all cancellations (CRITICAL ISSUE)
Great Britain (GBR) - 6.1%
Spain (ESP) - 5.0%
France (FRA) - 4.8%
Germany (DEU) - 3.4%
Italy (ITA) - 3.1%
Ireland (IRL) - 2.1%
Brazil (BRA) - 2.1%
Belgium (BEL) - 1.9%
USA - 1.9%
Action Items:

Develop targeted retention programs for Portuguese guests
Consider cultural preferences in booking policies
Offer incentives for guests from high-cancellation countries
6. Booking Channel Analysis
Where Bookings Come From:

All Bookings:

Online Travel Agencies (TA): 47%
Groups: 19%
Direct bookings: 12%
Offline TA/Tour Operators: 11%
Corporate: 4%
Canceled Bookings:

Online Travel Agencies: 45.6% (highest cancellation source)
Groups: 28.2%
Offline TA/TO: 19.4%
Direct: 4.1%
Corporate: 2.3%
Insight: Online channels drive both bookings and cancellations

7. Price Comparison: The Cancellation-Price Connection
ADR: Cancelled vs Not Cancelled (2016-2017)

What the Chart Reveals: The red line (canceled bookings) and green line (completed bookings) tell parallel stories with an interesting twist - they move together, but the red line often sits slightly higher.

Key Finding:

Canceled bookings generally have slightly higher prices than completed bookings
The lines follow similar patterns but never quite touch
Price sensitivity may be a factor in cancellation decisions
Pattern is consistent across 2016-2017
What This Means:

Higher prices = Higher risk of cancellation
Premium bookings need extra attention and retention efforts
Price-conscious guests are more committed to their bookings
Business Implication:

Consider flexible pricing tiers with different cancellation terms
Offer incentives for non-refundable premium bookings
Create loyalty rewards to offset price concerns for high-value reservations
