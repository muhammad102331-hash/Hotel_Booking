## Key Findings with Visual Insights

### 1. **The Cancellation Crisis: 37% of Revenue at Risk**

![Booking Cancellation Distribution](https://github.com/muhammad102331-hash/Hotel_Booking/blob/main/%F0%9F%93%88%20Visual%20Assets/report_images/1_cancellation_distribution.png)

**The Story:**
Looking at our booking data, we discovered a startling reality - **37 out of every 100 bookings are canceled**. The bar chart reveals this stark contrast: while 63,000+ bookings were completed successfully, nearly 37,000 guests changed their minds and canceled.

**What This Means:**
- Imagine filling 370 rooms in a 1,000-room hotel, only to have them suddenly become empty
- This creates a domino effect: lost revenue, wasted resources, and missed opportunities to fill those rooms
- Staff planning becomes challenging when you can't predict actual occupancy

**The Visual Impact:**
The chart shows two towering bars - the blue (not canceled) significantly higher than the orange (canceled), but the orange bar is still alarmingly large. This isn't a minor issue; it's a business-critical challenge.

### 2. **Tale of Two Hotels: Why City Hotels Struggle More**

![Reservation Status by Hotel Type](https://github.com/muhammad102331-hash/Hotel_Booking/blob/main/%F0%9F%93%88%20Visual%20Assets/report_images/2_hotel_comparison.png)

**The Story:**
When we compared our City Hotels to Resort Hotels, a clear pattern emerged. City Hotels are experiencing a **42% cancellation rate** compared to Resort Hotels' **28%**. 

**What the Data Reveals:**
The side-by-side comparison shows that while both hotel types receive significant bookings, City Hotels see a much larger proportion colored in the "canceled" shade. This 14-percentage-point difference represents thousands of lost room-nights.

**Why This Happens:**
- Business travelers (who prefer City Hotels) have more flexible schedules
- Corporate bookings often change due to meeting cancellations
- Resort guests (vacation travelers) are more committed to their plans
- Leisure travelers have made emotional investments in their trips

**Business Impact:**
City Hotels need different strategies than Resort Hotels - one-size-fits-all policies won't work.

### 3. **The Price Story: Following the Money Across Time**

![Average Daily Rate Trends](https://github.com/muhammad102331-hash/Hotel_Booking/blob/main/%F0%9F%93%88%20Visual%20Assets/report_images/3_adr_by_hotel.png)

**The Story:**
When we tracked room prices over three years (2015-2017), an interesting pattern emerged. Both hotel types maintain competitive pricing, with rates hovering around similar ranges, but City Hotels (orange line) show more volatility than the steadier Resort Hotels (green line).

**Reading the Chart:**
- The green line (Resort Hotel) flows relatively smoothly, showing vacation travelers are more predictable
- The orange line (City Hotel) has more spikes and valleys, reflecting business travel's unpredictable nature
- Both lines trend together, suggesting market-wide factors affect pricing

**Key Observations:**
- Prices range from $50 to $150+ per night across both properties
- Seasonal peaks are visible but manageable
- Neither hotel is dramatically overpricing or underpricing

**Strategic Insight:**
The pricing itself isn't the problem - it's competitive. The challenge lies in matching the right price to the right guest at the right time.

### 4. **Seasonal Patterns: The Rhythm of Bookings**

![Monthly Booking Cancellations](https://github.com/muhammad102331-hash/Hotel_Booking/blob/main/%F0%9F%93%88%20Visual%20Assets/report_images/4_monthly_cancellations.png)

**The Story:**
This monthly view reveals the heartbeat of our booking business. Watch how the blue (not canceled) and orange (canceled) bars rise and fall together throughout the year.

**Monthly Booking Trends:**
- **Peak Season:** Summer months (June-August) have highest bookings AND highest cancellations
- **Low Season:** Winter months (December-February) have fewer bookings overall
- Cancellations follow booking volume - more bookings = more cancellations

**Strategic Insight:**
- Focus retention efforts during peak booking months when stakes are highest
- Implement flexible policies during low season to maintain occupancy
- Prepare for cancellation surges before summer season

### 5. **Geographic Analysis: The Portugal Problem**

**The Striking Visual:**
The pie chart reveals something shocking - a massive slice (70.8%) belongs to Portugal. This single country dominates cancellations, making all other countries look tiny in comparison.

**Top 10 Countries by Cancellation Volume:**
1. **Portugal (PRT)** - 70.8% of all cancellations (CRITICAL ISSUE)
2. **Great Britain (GBR)** - 6.1%
3. **Spain (ESP)** - 5.0%
4. **France (FRA)** - 4.8%
5. **Germany (DEU)** - 3.4%

7. **Ireland (IRL)** - 2.1%
8. **Brazil (BRA)** - 2.1%
9. **Belgium (BEL)** - 1.9%
10. **USA** - 1.9%

**Action Items:**
- Develop targeted retention programs for Portuguese guests

### 7. **Price Comparison: The Cancellation-Price Connection**

![ADR: Cancelled vs Not Cancelled (2016-2017)](https://github.com/muhammad102331-hash/Hotel_Booking/blob/main/%F0%9F%93%88%20Visual%20Assets/report_images/6_adr_comparison.png)

**What the Chart Reveals:**
The red line (canceled bookings) and green line (completed bookings) tell parallel stories with an interesting twist - they move together, but the red line often sits slightly higher.

**Key Finding:**
- Canceled bookings generally have **slightly higher prices** than completed bookings
- The lines follow similar patterns but never quite touch
- Price sensitivity may be a factor in cancellation decisions
- Pattern is consistent across 2016-2017

**What This Means:**
- Higher prices = Higher risk of cancellation
- Premium bookings need extra attention and retention efforts
- Price-conscious guests are more committed to their bookings

**Business Implication:**
- Consider flexible pricing tiers with different cancellation terms
- Offer incentives for non-refundable premium bookings
- Create loyalty rewards to offset price concerns for high-value reservations
